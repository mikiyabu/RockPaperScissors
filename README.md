10/21/22 - Started project, layed out colors and came up with a plan (colors, buttons, words, etc.)

10/22/22 - Made the layout of the UI with HTML & CSS, alls left to do is work on the JS and merge the UI branch to the main one

10/25/22 - Finished JS, rock paper scissors is now playable but will add a feature so the user will know what the user and bot chose and another feature where when someone wins it displays who won
